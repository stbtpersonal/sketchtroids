An Asteroids clone!
• Full painted background
• The "asteroids" are painted objects like heads, hands, feet--both human and animal. It could also be geometric shapes.
• Ooh! First level is relatively simple: simple painted background and simple geometric shapes.
• Second level could be more difficult objects, like bottles and cups and mice and stuff.
• Last level is, like, super difficult stuff like heads and hands.
• So anyway, the objects all rotate around themselves much like the original asteroids in Asteroids did.
• All of this is gonna be a real challenge to paint.

• Complicated objects get broken down into more simple objects. Say, a face would break into an eye, nose, mouth, and ear.
• Level 1: a complex geometric shape (pyramid + cylinder) would break down into its base components (a pyramid and a cylinder)

• The backgrounds could be surreal but not abstract. It's not a challenge if the backgrounds aren't painted.

• Every level should have a different lighting scheme.
• Sometimes incorporate 
• For example, a kitchen level (cups, silverware, fruit) could have a window in the background, and the "asteroids" would be painted to reflect that somehow.
• In a space level there's no bounce light so it's pitch black after their terminators. That sorta thing.

• Maybe play around with some styles too.
• Geometric shapes land could be all pencil shaded, for example.
• On the same vain, a cartoon world could be cell shaded.

• The ship, bullets, effects, and UI should all probably match the level, visually.

• And now, to dial it back a bit so that it has a chance in hell to ever be finished, maybe just have sketches or lineart for all stages.
• Maybe the first level is on lined school paper, the second stage is on printer paper, and the last stage is on nice brown sketchbook paper.
• You can even call it Sketchtroids if you're feeling cheeky.

• This should be written in JS. JS is dead simple and it's good to have a complete JS project to show off under your belt.
• Although do try Haste (the Haskell to JS compiler) since that could be fun.
• Publish it on itch.io. They now allow you to make a page secret and making it accessible only by sharing a link to it.
